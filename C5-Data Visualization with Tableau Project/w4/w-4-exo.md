| **Other requirements** | For Hanna: <br>- Clearly visual-oriented so that she can understand data correlating with numbers - Hanna is not good at numbers and stats;<br>- The analytics should be rather static/exploratory then actionable (Hanna needs to turn the many findings by the retail analysts into a sales strategy);<br>- Pre-highlighting the most meaningful in the reporting;<br>- Selecting some example according to the patterns found and Highlighting the percentage of this population;<br>For other board member: Keeping Large fonts (poor eyesight)<br>Other: <br>- The presentation must appear as a very synthetic view and easy to manipulate because Sylvia will have only 5-7 minutes to present to board members;<br>- Starting with the top-level facts because board members donâ€™t understand the minutiae of the business and prefer quickly hearing key points;<br>- The visualization will be viewed from a great distance across the room |
