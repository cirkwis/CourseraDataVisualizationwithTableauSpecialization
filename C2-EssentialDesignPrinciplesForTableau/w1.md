# Getting Started in Effective and Ineffective Visuals

## Introduction of Effective and Ineffective Visuals

How to choose the right visualization ?
- One of the challenges with doing visualizations is actually being able to decide what is the best visualization for the type of data;
- Knowing the intent or purpose of a particulare visual and its advantages and disadvantages will help inform the decision;

We need to learn:
- Identify various types of visualizations in Tableau
- Discuss the role of ethics in developing a data visualization 
- Examine and improve ineffective visualization 

## Types of Visualizations 
In this section, we will discuss the types of visualizations that are available to you and you will be able to recognize and identify them when you start to do your own visualizations. 

### Text or number visualization

- It's very effective if what you're trying to show is something very high-level as part of an overall dashboard package. 
- This simple text conveys exactly what you need and has the information all contained with it, and is quite widely used as a KPI or key performance indicator. 

### Table visualization 
- Tables convey a lot of information 
  - The 2x2 table has a lot of power in terms of what it can convey and in terms of looking at comparisons across categories; 
- Too big = less effective

### Heat map - Cross-tabulation 
![Heat map](./w-1-2.png "Heat map")
- Using color to visually emphasize information based on a certain set of parameters; 
  - For example, it can identify the top N in some category or the bottom of some category. 

### Scatter plots

- If you have a lot of information and it's in a forum that's sort of a continuous variable which is data could take on any number and you're comparing them with another set of numbers: Scatter plot is the best way to see if there's any inference that you can draw in the relationships or the correlation between the two variables. 
  - You plot them on an x and y-axis and see if there's some sort of connection between the two or perhaps there's some sort of clustering that you can find relationships with when you're drawing a scatter plot;

### Line graphs
![Line graph](./w-1-4.png "Line graph")
- It's used quite extensively when visualizing data across time. 
  - If you have any time variable, one of the first things you ought to do is to do a simple line graph and see how well you can see if there's a trend; 
  - Perhaps you can get into some forecasting to see really where the data may be headed in the future

### Bar graphs 
![Bar graphs](./w-1-5.png "Bar graphs")
- Vertical, horizontal and stacked are three common types of bar graphs
  - Stacked version allows you to see clearly if one category is substantially bigger than the other
- It's based on how much information you are trying to convey as to whether you put it in. 

### Waterfall graphs

- a fancier version of a bar graph allow you to really be able to quickly see the areas and to be able to answer questions very quickly and easily;

### Map visualization

- Map is crucial for spatial analysis; 
- It's used with spatial components, geography, latitude and longitude data;

### Pie charts
- It's not "easy as pie" and have bad reputation
- Useful in certain specific instances
