# Design For Understanding

## Design For Understanding Introduction
Making sense of large multidimensional data set are: 
- tasks for encoding, arranging and presenting data to reveal meaningful patterns and stories for audiences; 
- keep the brain in mind when designing visualization; 

There are two systems: 
- System 1: involes automatic and relatively immediate perception; 
- System 2: is a solver and more deliberative thought process; 

Designing visualizations that work best for the target audience: 
- As you create your visualizations, think of yourself as a kind of architecture! 
- Your basic building materials include visual encoding elements such as color, shape and size;
- Assemble visual encoding elements to leverage user's perceptual abilities;
- As an architecture, you need to consider factors ranging from construction materials and location to people and the purpose for which the building is intended; 
- Designs may begin with visual perception principles (Proximity, Similarity, Enclosure, Closure, Connectivity) but need to finish with a clear and acurate depicition of data; 

## Know your audience(s)
- Data visualizations come in a wide and expanding range of forms, have many different purposes and have diverse sets of potential audiences;
- Discover considerations for user-centered design including audience, purpose and representations
  - Analysts who need to comb through data to find interesting patterns, trends and anomalies;
  - Executives who need quick, clear, and reliable summaries of some initiatives or campaingn;
- Consider about levels of information density and detail that fit for targeted audience: one size definitely does not fit all; 
- Knowing your audience means:
  - Recognizing simplicity is relative to your audience; 
  - Thinking about audiences (purposes and context) for your data visualization; 
  - the purpose for visualization and the types of data being used; 
- Good visualization design means effective communication with your audience (needs, skills, knowledge and goals); 
- Few fundamental questions to keep in mind at the outset: 
  - What are the interests, needs and goals of your audience? How will your visualization meet those needs? 
    - Audience needs can range from curiosity to urgent real-time alerts such as 1- the relationships of life expectancies and personal income levels in different parts of the world; 2- a specific need like seeing a real-time alert about a potential hacker intrusion to a network; 
  - What level of familiarity should your audience have with this subject? What level do they actually have? (novice, user, expert). Prior knowledge can sometimes help and other times hinder the ability and usability of design; 
  - What level of detail and information density that fit targeted audience? Too much or too little detail are both counterproductive - depending on who's looking at the visualization; 
  - How much control do users have? More user control may require more effort and knowledge from the user. A potential trade-off here is that control can require more effort and knowledge from the user. Simplicity is relative for different types of users; 
    - *Retail analysts* may need tools to discern patterns and trends in the data. Their goal is to faciliate user's ability to explore the data; *Sales presentations* will have different goals: conveying specific information (such as quarterly returns to executives) as concisely as possible;
- Detail is also relative but it help us to guide the design strategy: 
  - Time scale needs can vary amongst audience members: in case of the analyst, she/he may need the ability to easily view data in various time scales from  days to years, whereas a sales person may only need to show quarterly results;
- Personas are collections of user types that capture characteristics, goals, and needs of different types of users:
  - a persona that represents a retail analyst and another that represents a sales person; 
  - personas may not be useful for every design project, they can provide useful summaries of important people types that can help sharpen thinking about targeted design; 
- Key things to remember: **Ask questions <-> Adjust design <-> Use personas <-> Understand and anticipate audience's needs**;
