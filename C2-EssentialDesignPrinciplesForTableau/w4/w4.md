# Design For Understanding

## Design For Understanding Introduction
Making sense of large multidimensional data set are: 
- tasks for encoding, arranging and presenting data to reveal meaningful patterns and stories for audiences; 
- keep the brain in mind when designing visualization; 

There are two systems: 
- System 1: involes automatic and relatively immediate perception; 
- System 2: is a solver and more deliberative thought process; 

Designing visualizations that work best for the target audience: 
- As you create your visualizations, think of yourself as a kind of architecture! 
- Your basic building materials include visual encoding elements such as color, shape and size;
- Assemble visual encoding elements to leverage user's perceptual abilities;
- As an architecture, you need to consider factors ranging from construction materials and location to people and the purpose for which the building is intended; 
- Designs may begin with visual perception principles (Proximity, Similarity, Enclosure, Closure, Connectivity) but need to finish with a clear and acurate depicition of data;
