# Design Best Practices

In this section we will cover 3 points: 
- Apply Gestalat principles and pre-attentive attributes 
- Identify and discuss accessibility and aesthetics 
- Apply visualization and tips

## Gestalt principle: Proximity
By the end of this module, you'll be able to recognize how and why a Gestalt principle is being used; 
- Proximity: things close together tend to be more related than things further apart
- Proximity is absolutely fundamental to geographical analysis, spatial statistics and other types of fields related to geography. It's the basic for what's known as spatial interpolation in geographic information system;

- Proximity could be used when you're doing a categorical plot and these categorical scatter plots allows you to look and see if there's any clustering that occurs based on the scatter plot that you draw; 
- Proximity principle implies that there are more relationships to things that are closer to each other than there are further from each other;
