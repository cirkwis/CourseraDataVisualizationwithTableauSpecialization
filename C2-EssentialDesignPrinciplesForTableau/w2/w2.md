# Visual Perception and Cognitive Principles Introduction

In this section, we'll focus on: 
- Define cognitive load and clutter;
- Illustrate the principles of visual perception
- Use contrast in visualization 
- Define and use pre-attentive attributes 
- Declutter visualization

## Cognitive load and clutter
- ***Cognitive*** load is the amount of mental effort required to interpret information. For data visualization, we need to learn how to minimize the cognitive load while also communicating the message accurately. There are 3 types of cognitive load: Intrinsic, Extraneous and Germane
  - **Intrinsic Cognitive** load is the amount of memory that we need to understand something. Different tasks requires different amounts of thought and attention;
  - **Extraneous Cognitive** load relates to how information is presented; Poor design require more effort to identify problem and create a mental image;
  - **Germane Cognitive** load is the way for the brain to look for patterns to develop context of visualization for late reference. It's to help tak a cognitive issue and present it in an easy and meaningful way;
- ***Clutter*** is one of those things that we know when we see it. For data visualization, it's about determining what need to be in a visualization and doesn't need to be in the visualization to reduce the clutter: Clutter is all the things you remove while still preserving key ideas; 
  - The reason we want to reduce clutter is so that we can minimize cognitive load of the reader of the data visualization. Less clutter means more effective visualizations; 
  - How would remove the clutter and what could have been done differently?

    - 3D effect: let's not do that unless you're graphing three dimensionally
    - Dark grid lines: dark grid lines are really helpful if it's going to aid in the visualiation itself
    - Overuse of bright and bold colors 
    - There is no apparent sorting of the data being shown 
    - An unhelpful axis
  - 3D doesn't improve a visualization: Skews information and Adds confusion; 
  - Something is cluttered doesn't mean it shouldn't be there. Redundancy (clutter) can help users manage cognitive load. Sometime, it nonetheless helps with the cognitive load: 
    - Currency symbols
    - Percent signs 
    - Commas within numbers 
    - Scientific notation
  - Some details many add clarity (but sometime clutter). Clarity reduces the effort required to comprehend complex data;
