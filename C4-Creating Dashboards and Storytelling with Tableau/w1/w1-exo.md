# Practice Peer-graded Assignment - Part 1: Create a Design Checklist

After reading the [project brief](./w1-exo-project-brief.md) and the personas, here are the design checklist to guide the exploration of the data and the design decisions for the final deliverables. The key objective with this activity is to be able to define audience (user), stakeholders (business or personal goals), and the dataset (Super Store).

| **Key Features**       | - Filtering facilities to explore data sets in different population; <br>- Drill down charts to answer multiple questions;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Other requirements** | For Sylvia: <br>- Clearly visual-oriented so that she can understand data correlating with numbers - Sylvia is not good at numbers and stats;<br>- The analytics should be rather static/exploratory then actionable (Sylvia needs to turn the many findings by the retail analysts into a sales strategy).<br>- Pre-highlighting the most meaningful in the reporting;<br>For Terrence: Keeping Large fonts (poor eyesight)<br>Other: <br>- The presentation must appear as a very synthetic view and easy to manipulate because Sylvia will have only 5-7 minutes to present to board members;<br>- Starting with the top-level facts because board members don’t understand the minutiae of the business and prefer quickly hearing key points;<br>- The visualization will be viewed from a great distance across the room |
