# Visual analytic with Tableau - Dates

## Discrete and continuous dates
- Discrete means distinct values - if your analysis requires you to have discrete marks that can be sorted, you would use the field as discrete which be colored blue on the view; 
- Continous dates field is manifested as a green pill which means continuous unbroken value in a range. If you know that you want to look at a trends over a continuous period of time, you would want to use a continuous date which would be colored green on the view;
- When to use: 
  - Treating dates as a continuous quantity is particularly useful when you use Gantt charts or want to see trends using charts lines over time; 
  - But if you want to be able to sort your date field for a specific visual, discrete dates maybe more beneficial;  

## Date hierarchies
- Year - Quarter - Month - Day: it's helpful when you want to be able to drill down into your data;
- Date hierarchy is available for both discrete and continuous date fields but with different behaviors. In the case of continuous date field, when you drill down on the hierarchy, no additional pills are created, only one pill is maintained in your shelf;
