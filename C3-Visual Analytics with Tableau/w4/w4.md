# Mapping
- Mapping is a fine and effective way to visualize geographic data; 
- There are different types of geographic data in Tableau (country, state, city, postal code) and it's recognized automatically by Tableau;
  - You can change the geographic role in data source pane (area code, CBSA/MSA, city,...) 
- In Tableau, you can customize your maps by changing colors, shapes and sizes as well as your map background to better tell your story; 

## Custom Geocoding
- Sometimes, the location data you have might be incomplete, or have an error, or may not recognized by Tableau as a location: a notification is thrown as "unknow" so that you can:
  - *Edit locations* by specify more on geographic r√¥le; 
  - Filter data; 
  - Show data at default location;

## Dual maps 
- Dual map is the combination of a filled map and a symbol map into one to help provide additional context that not available when showing one map;
