# Visual Analytics with Tableau - Table Calculations
- Table calculations are computation that apply to the values in the entire table and are often dependent on the table itself; 
- Table calculations are calculations that are performed on data that is already in your table or chart, so doing additional calculations on top of previous calculations; 
- In this section, we'll: 
  - Create new calculated field allowing you to compare fields, apply aggregations and more; 
  - Use quick table calculations; 
  - Customize table calculations; 
  - Work with filter and parameters;

## Calculated fields
- Creating calculated fields means creating new variables from/or not existing variables; 
- Without needing to make any changes to your database, calculated fields allow:
  - Compare fields; 
  - Apply aggregation; 
  - Apply logic; 
  - Concatenate strings; 
  - Convert date; 
  - ...
- Calculated fields are re-usable, drag-and-drop fields, used in your data windows and cache table;
- You can make calculation on the top of calculation; 
- There are a lot of function based on types; 

## Table calculations
- You can do calculations after Tableau has queried the database; 
- Works in the cache table and make calculations on visible result: once your visualization is rendered, we can ask Tableau to litterally look at the results, numbers bars, or plots and do math on visible results; 
- Table calculations allow you to compare a singular measure to itself;

## Filter
- Filter is the process of removing certain values or a range of values from a result set; 
- There are 3 basic filters in Tableau: dimension, measure and date; 
- We can apply the filter over: 
  - Field values; 
  - Calculations; 
  - Context-based filters; 

## Parameters
- Parameters are the dynamic values that can replace constant values in calculations, filters, and reference lines; 
- Example: you want to make a calculation returns true if your sales are greater than 500$ and false for otherwise. You can replace the constant value of 500 in the formula with the parameters. By using parameters control, you can dynamically change the threshold in your calculation; 
- You can create new parameters based on a field in the data pane;
